Professional Summary
Hello! I'm Daniel, a Senior Scientist and Data Scientist deeply passionate about using advanced analytics, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) to tackle complex challenges and spark innovation. My journey into the world of data science is built upon a robust foundation of analytical problem-solving, a skill I initially developed and refined within the pharmaceutical industry. I find immense satisfaction in the process of transforming raw data into meaningful, actionable insights

My core expertise lies in Python, and I'm adept with a wide array of its powerful libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. I enjoy engaging with the entire data science lifecycle, from meticulously wrangling large datasets using SQL to constructing predictive models and architecting AI-powered applications. I'm particularly proud of achievements such as securing 4th place in a Kaggle Playground Series competition and developing an innovative troubleshooting chatbot leveraging OpenAI and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

Beyond these specific projects, my experience extends to designing, developing, and deploying REST APIs with Python frameworks like FastAPI, significantly improving data accessibility and inter-system connectivity. As an enthusiastic member of AstraZeneca's internal Coding Network, I regularly share my work and find joy in mentoring and coaching others. Coding isn't just a skill for me; it's genuinely one of my favorite activities, and I am a strong advocate for lifelong learning. This drive pushes me to continually expand my horizons, evidenced by my certifications from IBM, Google, and DataCamp in fields like AI development, data analytics, and TensorFlow, as well as my active exploration of cybersecurity through platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe.

I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and insights, which is why I regularly contribute articles on coding and data science to my Medium platform, "CodeHalwell". Whether it's automating intricate tasks, building sophisticated predictive models, or diving headfirst into emerging technologies, I am consistently driven by the intellectual challenge and the profound opportunity to make a tangible, positive impact.
